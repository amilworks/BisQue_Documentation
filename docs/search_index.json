["docker-installation.html", "Docker Installation", " Docker Installation Docker If you would like to have your own version of BisQue with minimal effort, use the Docker version of BisQue. The source code installation can be found here. Download. Ensure you have the latest release by first running the following pull command: docker pull amilworks/bisque05-caffe-xenial:amil Run. To run the docker version of BisQue locally, start a bisque server on the host port 8080: docker run --name bisque --rm -p 8080:8080 amilworks/bisque05-caffe-xenial:amil and point your browser at http://localhost:8080. You should see a BisQue homepage similar to the one on bisque.ece.ucsb.edu. If you do not see the homepage, check to make sure that port 8080 is not being used by another container or application and that you have correctly mapped the ports using -p 8080:8080, where -p is short for port. Registering Modules. To register all the modules to your local server: Login to your BisQue server using admin:admin Find the module manager under the Admin button on the top right hand corner Put http://localhost:8080/engine_service in the right panel where it says Enter Engine URL and hit Load NOTE: Use localhost:8080 here because it’s internal to the container. Drag and Drop MetaData to the left panel—or whatever module you would like—and the module will now be registered and available for use. You can make the module Public by hitting Set Public in the left panel, which basically means the module is Published and ready for public use. Custom Modules. If you would like to build and test your own module locally, using host mounted modules will make life easier to build, test, debug, and deploy locally. Copy the module directory out of the container and into the folder on your local system named container-modules. docker cp bisque:/source/modules container-modules Copy your module into the container-modules folder on your local system. Restart the container with host mounted modules. Be careful with the command $(pwd)/container-modules that we are using here. If the /container-modules is not in the specified path, you will not see any of the modules during the registration process. docker stop bisque docker run --name bisque --rm -p 8080:8080 -v $(pwd)/container-modules:/source/modules amilworks/bisque05-caffe-xenial:amil Register your module from the above steps in “3. Registering Modules. ”, using the Module Manager. Pushing your Module to Production. If you feel that your module is ready to be added to the production version of BisQue, please feel free to contact us and we will gladly begin the process. Data Storage. Use an external data directory so you don’t lose data when the service stops Uploaded image and workdirs are store in /source/data. You can change this to be a host mounted directory with docker run --name bisque --rm -p 8080:8080 -v $(pwd)/container-data:/source/data amilworks/bisque05-caffe-xenial:amil The default sqlite database is stored inside the container at /source/data/bisque.db The uploaded images are stored inside the container at /source/data/imagedir "]
